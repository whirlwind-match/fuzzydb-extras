
To get going:
- Run "Run Server V2 (for build Standalone Index)" large memory footprint (includes DbToUploadfromClient v1 cos we need the postcode use count object which Postcode project is using)
- Run "SI - DbIndexerUpdate" (this creates attrDefs).

- Run application (e.g. WhirlwindDemo V2)
- Insert lots of records

- Shutdown Db

- Run "Run Server V2 (for benchmark Standalone Index)" smaller memory footprint (ditto)
- Run application (e.g. WhirlwindDemo V2)
- Do benchmarks
